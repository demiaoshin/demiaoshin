- Group Project
  - Intelligent TODO List App
 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- UX Design
  - Doing the Google Career Certificate in UX Design (currently on Course 2)
  - Would like to go into UX Design in the future âœ¨
- Python
  - Doing a 100 days of code in Python (though its currently in hiatus, will resume soon)
- App Development
  - Constantly coming up with random app ideas
